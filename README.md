# The Button Game

This is a small game experiment using Go as the programming language. The game is called "The Button Game" and it is a simple clicker game where the player has to click a button to keep alive as long as possible.

## Getting Started

To get started with the game, you'll need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install Go from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/

Once you have Go installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mrfastwind/the-button-game.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd the-button-game`
3. Build the project: `go build`
4. Run the game: `./the-button-game`

## Gameplay

The game consists of a single button that the player has to click. Each time the button is clicked, the lifespan of the buton increases.

## Future additions

- Add stat for tracking lifespan of the button.
- Add different tiers for how much life the button at the moment of saving it.
